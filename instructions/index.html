    <!-- <b>We will ask for camera ready papers after the workshop has completed (1-2 weeks post). This should allow for authors to receive feedback during the workshop that authors can incorporate into the paper alongside the reviews.</b>
    <br/><br/>
  For the workshop, authors are only required to give a 5 minute talk about your work. We do encourage a poster or at least a summary slide to help showcase the work during breakouts but it is not required.

Submissions are single-blind review and do not need to be anonymized.

    ROLLING SUBMISSIONS: 
    Due to the early registration deadline for HRI being January 31, we have
    implemented rolling submissions with updated deadlines. Make sure to submit 
    by Jan 28th if you want notification by January 30, 2022 UTC-12 before the
    HRI 2022 early registration deadline.
    <br/> <br/>
    Submissions will close <b>February 17, 2022 UTC-12.</b>

The 5th International Workshop on Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality
for Human-Robot Interaction (VAM-HRI) will bring together HRI, robotics,
and mixed reality researchers to address challenges in mixed reality 
interactions between humans and robots. Topics relevant to the workshop 
include development of robots that can interact with humans in mixed reality, 
use of virtual reality for developing interactive robots, the design of augmented 
reality interfaces that mediate communication between humans and robots, 
social applications for virtual and mixed reality in HRI, the investigations of 
mixed reality interfaces for robot learning, comparisons of the capabilities and 
perceptions of robots and virtual agents, and best design practices. Special 
topics of interest this year include VAM-HRI research during the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic as well as the ethical implications of VAM-HRI research. 
VAM-HRI 2022 will follow on the success of VAM-HRI 2018-21 and advance 
the cause of this nascent research community.

<br/> <br/>

VAM-HRI accepts both EXTENDED ABSTRACTS (2-4 page papers 
presenting previous, current, or proposed work) and FULL PAPERS 
(5-8 page papers presenting novel work). References do not count towards 
total page count. 

<br/> <br/>


Papers will undergo mutual review; as such, <b>authors of submitted papers will be
expected to provide a small number of reviews for fellow authors.</b>
<br/> <br/>
All accepted papers will be accompanied by talks and/or poster presentations
and will be archived on the workshop website. 
<br/> <br/>
 All communication during the workshop will take
place on a <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vam-hri/shared_invite/zt-gjq1jtld-PzxfFywTi0qBF6CUX5julw">Slack channel</a>.
<br/> <br/>




VAM-HRI 2022 is looking to follow on the success of the last three years, and
welcomes contributions on topics including but not limited to:
<br/> <br/>
&middot; AR-based intent communication <br/>
&middot; AR-based behavior explanation <br/>
&middot; Social applications for VAM-HRI <br/>
&middot; AR/VR for robot testing and diagnostics <br/>
&middot; AR/VR for robot learning <br/>
&middot; VR for HRI human-subject experimentation <br/>
&middot; Mixed-reality language grounding <br/>
&middot; AR-augmented natural language generation <br/>
&middot; AR-enabled robot control <br/>
&middot; AR/VR for safety around robots <br/>
&middot; Architectures for AR/VR-based HRI <br/>
&middot; Computational modeling within AR/VR-based HRI <br/>
&middot; AR/VR for expanding social interactions <br/>
&middot; VAM-HRI research in the time of COVID-19 <br/>
&middot; Social and ethical implications of VAM for HRI <br/>

<br></br>

Please note that some double blind conferences (e.g., HRI itself) may consider a preprint online 
as violating the double blind process leading to a desk reject. Please double check the policy if you plan to submit
a "conference/journal ready" paper to one of these venues in the future. Most single-blind (e.g., RO-MAN/ICRA)
have been completely fine submitting papers that were preprint versions accepted into this workshop.
