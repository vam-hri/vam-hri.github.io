        The 7th International Workshop on Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality
        for Human-Robot Interaction (VAM-HRI) will bring together HRI, robotics,
        and mixed reality researchers to address challenges in mixed reality
        interactions between humans and robots in a hybrid workshop format, allowing
        for participation both in-person and remotely. VAM-HRI 2024 will follow on
        the success of VAM-HRI 2018-23 and advance the cause of this nascent
        research community.


        <br /> <br />

        VAM-HRI accepts submissions of length from 2-8 pages presenting
        current or proposed work. Papers posted online without prior peer review
        (e.g., already posted on ArXiv as a preprint but not already accepted into
        another venue) can be submitted. References do not count towards
        total page count. A submission link will be provided closer to the first deadline.

        <br /> <br />
        All accepted papers will be accompanied by talks and/or poster presentations
        and will be archived on the workshop website.
        <br /> <br />

        VAM-HRI 2023 is looking to follow on the success of the last five years, and
        welcomes contributions on topics including but not limited to:
        <br /> <br />
        &middot; AR-based intent communication <br />
        &middot; AR-based behavior explanation <br />
        &middot; Social/Socially Assistive applications of VAM-HRI <br />
        &middot; AR/VR for robot testing and diagnostics <br />
        &middot; AR/VR for robot learning <br />
        &middot; VR for HRI human-subject experimentation <br />
        &middot; Mixed-reality language grounding <br />
        &middot; AR-augmented natural language generation <br />
        &middot; AR-enabled robot control <br />
        &middot; AR/VR for safety around robots <br />
        &middot; Architectures for AR/VR-based HRI <br />
        &middot; Computational modeling within AR/VR-based HRI <br />
        &middot; AR/VR for expanding social interactions <br />
        &middot; VAM-HRI research in the time of COVID-19 <br />
        &middot; Social and ethical implications of VAM for HRI <br />

        <br></br>

        Please note that some double blind conferences (e.g., HRI itself) may consider a preprint online
        as violating the double blind process leading to a desk reject. Please double check the policy if you plan to
        submit
        a "conference/journal ready" paper to one of these venues in the future. Most single-blind (e.g., RO-MAN/ICRA)
        have been completely fine submitting papers that were preprint versions accepted into this workshop.
