    We will ask for camera ready papers after the workshop has completed (1-2 weeks post). This should allow for authors to receive feedback during the workshop that authors can incorporate into the paper alongside the reviews.
    <br/><br/>
  For the workshop, authors are only required to give a 5 minute talk about your work. We do encourage a poster or at least a summary slide to help showcase the work during breakouts but it is not required.
  <br/><br/>
    Submissions are closed. Notice of acceptance will be sent on or before Feb 27.
    <br/><br/>
Submissions are single-blind review and do not need to be anonymized.
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
    ROLLING SUBMISSIONS: 
We will be implementing rolling submissions.
            Submissions will typically take a week to review.
            Make sure to submit by Jan 20 if you want to be notified by Jan 30
            before the HRI 2021 early registration deadline on Jan 31.
            <b>The last submission deadline is Feb 24</b>.
<br/> <br/>

This year’s VAM-HRI workshop will present an opportunity to build community
within the virtual, augmented, and mixed reality research space as it relates
to human-robot interaction. The goals of the workshop include networking,
professional development, ideation, and envisioning the future of VAM-HRI as a
field. Special topics of interest include ethical implications and the COVID-19
pandemic. 

<br/><br/>
In line with this, <b>we encourage submissions to include a Broader
Impact section</b>, which will not be used to judge the quality of the submission.
These sections will help to inform discussions during the workshop. Papers will
be reviewed based on their relevance to the workshop’s topics of interests,
potential impact on the field, novelty of the contributing ideas, and overall
presentation and quality of the submitted article.
<br/> <br/>

<b>EXTENDED ABSTRACTS</b> (2-4 page papers presenting previous, current, or proposed work): This track is for submissions such as blue-sky ideas,
position-pieces, and early-stage research projects. Authors are highly
encouraged to include outlines of experiments for which the authors are seeking
feedback on.
<br/> <br/>
<b>FULL PAPERS</b> (5-8 page papers presenting novel work): This track is for submissions that are in a more mature state, and
authors are encouraged to submit work for which they would like feedback to
better polish their work for future conference proceedings. Authors are highly
encouraged to include preliminary or full experimental results for which
reviewers can give feedback directly on.
<br/> <br/>

References do not count towards total page count. Broader Impact
sections will also not count towards page limit nor affect the paper review.
<br/> <br/>

Papers will undergo mutual review; as such, <b>authors of submitted papers will be
expected to provide a small number of reviews for fellow authors.</b>
<br/> <br/>
All accepted papers will be accompanied by talks and/or poster presentations
and will be archived on the workshop website. 
<br/> <br/>

VIRTUAL FORMAT:
In order to accommodate various time zones due to the virtual format of the
workshop, we will be splitting the workshop into an “early” and “later” session
that attendees can attend. All communication during the workshop will take
place on a Slack channel.
<br/> <br/>
